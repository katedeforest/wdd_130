            <p>Hi there!</p>
            <p>I was raised in Utah, and I love my mountains.</p>
            <p>I am currently working as an agent on the Enrollment Service team
                for the Online Certificates and Degree Program supported by BYU-Pathway.
                I am currently a Marriage and Family Studies Major but I am considering switching to Web Design and Development.
            </p>
            <p>In addition to playing around with code,
                I love reading, writing, and hanging out with friends.
                My newest hobby is ballroom dance.
                I just started with it a couple semesters ago, but it's been really fun! 
                I go to almost every ballroom dance or country dance event on campus, 
                so if you see me at one, come say hello!
