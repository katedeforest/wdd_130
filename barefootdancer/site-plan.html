      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever been interested in ballroom dancing but never known where to start?
        <br>You thought ballroom dancing referred to only one thing, but as you start looking into it you are overwhelmed with all of the different types of ballroom dancing, some of which you have never heard of before. On top of that, you have no idea what each one is like or what makes them all different. 
        <br>How are you supposed to choose which one to learn?
        <br>That’s where my website comes in. 
        <br>I have gathered all the answers you seek into one clear, easy to access place.
        My website helps you understand which dance is which and provides a guide of which classes at BYUI you can take to learn each one. My website also introduces you to some basic dancing terms and step names to empower you in deciphering what everyone is talking about as you jump into the world of ballroom!</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My website will target students enrolled at Brigham Young University Idaho who have an interest in Ballroom Dancing. I want to specifically target students who have not done any ballroom dancing in the past or who have limited experience and exposure. I'm also hoping that the information I provide will be an easy reference for teachers to send to students or for more advanced students who need a quick refresher.
        <br>As I will provide some information about classes available to students at BYU-Idaho, this website may also be used by students who are considering attending and want more information about what is offered.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        What is Ballroom Dancing?
<br>Ballroom Dance is a set of partner dances which are enjoyed both socially and competitively around the world, mostly because of its performance and entertainment aspects. Ballroom dancing is also widely enjoyed on stage, film, and television. 
Ballroom dance may refer, at its widest definition, to almost any recreational dance with a partner. However, with the emergence of dance competition (now known as Dancesport), two principal schools have emerged (International and American) and the term is used more narrowly to refer to the dances recognized by those schools.

      <h3>International Style Dances</h3>
      <p>
        There are two principle schools of Ballroom Dance: International and American. The International Style, which is also known as the English Style, is danced throughout the world. It contains the more traditional ballroom dances that originated mostly in Europe, although is popular across the United States, Asia and Russia as well. 
        International styles include Waltz, Tango, Viennese Waltz, Foxtrot, and Tango.

      <h3>Foxtrot</h3>
      <p>
        The foxtrot is a smooth, progressive dance characterized by long, continuous flowing movements across the dance floor. It is danced to big band (usually vocal) music. The dance is similar in its look to waltz, although the rhythm is in a 4/4 time signature instead of 3/4. Developed in the 1910s, the foxtrot reached its height of popularity in the 1930s and remains practiced today.
